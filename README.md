# Carbon_Project
This project is made to find the relationship between the level of CO2 and some of the factors that may affect it. 
And also to consolidate the skills in working with Matplotlib module.
The following datasets (sources) were used for comparison:
data csv sources:

carbon dioxide:           https://www.co2.earth/co2-datasets   
human population:         https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?end=2021&start=1960
global temperature Earth: https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/
fossil fuel extraction    https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels
global meat production    https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production
sun activity              https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robervalt/sunspots
maning Bitcoin            https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index

The analysis shows some correlation for some data, and for some there is no connection or it is insignificant.
The final graphs for visibility are saved in a PDF file and allow you to make some conclusions.
